## This is a workaround to use global shortcuts for TODOIST on WINDOWS 10
*Created on 05/07/2017 - Version 1.2*

Since TODOIST its Windows 10 app doesnâ€™t support global shortcuts at the moment. I made a  little workarounds for the "open TODOIST" global shortcut.

    - alt+ctrl+a (Add new task)
    - alt+ctrl+s (open todoist)

### Instructions AutoHotKey workaround#
1. [Download AutoHotKey.](https://autohotkey.com/)
2. Install AutoHotKey.
3. [Download the Workaround.](https://github.com/rickstaa/Todoist_Global_Shortcuts_WIN10/archive/master.zip)
4. Unzip the Workaround file.
5. Go to the "Todoist_Global_Shortcuts_WIN10\TODOIST_AHK" folder.
6. Click on the "installer.vbs" file to install the workaround.

#### The workaround is not working what now?
	- Make sure AutoHotkey is running on startup.
	- Ensure that you have the right user privileges to add files to your user startup folder.
	- Still not working go to https://github.com/rickstaa/Todoist_Global_Shortcuts_WIN10/issues

#### VBS workaround
If you don't like using AutoHotKey there is a VBS workaround in the TODOIST_VBS folder. See the README.txt for instructions
