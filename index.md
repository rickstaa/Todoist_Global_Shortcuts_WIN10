## This is a workaround to use global shortcuts for TODOIST on WINDOWS 10
*Created on 05/07/2017 - Version 1.0*

Since TODOIST its Windows 10 app doesnâ€™t support global shortcuts at the moment. I made a 2 little workarounds for the "open TODOIST" global shortcut.

	1. AutoHotKey workaround (Easy to set up, fast and Relibably)
	2. Vbs Workaround (Hard to setup, can be slow)
	
These workarounds add the following global TODOIST shortcuts to WIN 10:

    - alt+ctrl+a (Add new task)
    - alt+ctrl+s (open todoist)


### Instructions AutoHotKey workaround
1. [Download AutoHotKey.](https://autohotkey.com/)
2. Install AutoHotKey.
3. [Download the Workaround.](https://github.com/rickstaa/Todoist_Global_Shortcuts_WIN10/archive/master.zip)
4. Unzip the Workaround file.
5. Go to Todoist_Global_Shortcuts_WIN10\TODOIST_AHK.
6. Press WINDOWS key.
7. Look for the "Todoist" program in the start menu.
8. Drag the "Todoist" program inside the "WinStoreAppLinks" folder.
7. Click on the "installer.vbs" file to install the workaround.

#### Note
Make sure autohotkey is running on startup 

### Instructions VBS workaround
For the vbs workaround instructions see the README.txt in the TODOIST_VBS folder.
