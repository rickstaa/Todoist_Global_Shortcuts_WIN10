This script adds global shortcuts to TODOIST ON WINDOWS 10. Due to some security rescrictions in windows 10 
I couldn't run the actual excutable. So this was the only way I could achive it. For bugs questions or surgestions 
go to:

== Instructions ==

Place the folder in one of the following folders that are scanned by windows
* Desktop (C:\Desktop)
* Start Menu folder (C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\)
* Programs folder (C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs)
There might be other folders but those are the onces I tested.

- Add global shortcut to open todoist -
1. Place the folder anywhere you like.
2. Left click on the "Open Todoist Shortcut"
3. Set a keyboard shortcut in the "Keyboard Shortcut" field.

- Add a global shortcut to open todoist and add task -
1. Place the folder anywhere you like.
2. Left click on the "Add Task Shortcut"
3. Set a keyboard shortcut in the "Keyboard Shortcut" field.

Enjoy,
