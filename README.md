# This is a workaround to use global shortcuts for TODOIST on WINDOWS 10
*Created on 05/07/2017 - Version 1.0*

Since TODOIST its Windows 10 app doesn’t support global shortcuts at the moment. I made a 2 little workarounds for the "open TODOIST" global shortcut.

	1. AutoHotKey workaround (Easy to set up, fast and Relibably)
	2. Vbs Workaround (Hard to setup, can be slow)
	
These workarounds add the following global TODOIST shortcuts to WIN 10:

    - alt+ctrl+a (Add new task)
    - alt+ctrl+s (open todoist)


## INSTRUCTIONS AutoHotKey workaround
1. Download AutoHotKey from https://autohotkey.com/
2. Install AutoHotKey from https://github.com/rickstaa/Todoist_Global_Shortcuts_WIN10/archive/master.zip
3. Download the Workaround.
4. Unzip the Workaround file
5. Go to Todoist_Global_Shortcuts_WIN10\TODOIST_AHK
6. Drag the "WinStoreAppLinks" folder into the "Program Files Shortcut"
7. Drag the "Todoist_global_Shortcuts.ahk" file into the "Startup Folder Shortcut

**If the installer doens't work open the README file inside the TODOIST_AHK folder for the manual approach.**

### NOTES
Make sure autohotkey is running on startup 

## INSTRUCTIONS VBS workaround
For the vbs workaround instructions see the README.txt in the TODOIST_VBS folder.
