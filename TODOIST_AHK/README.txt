﻿# This is a workaround to add global Todoist shortcuts to WINDOWS 10 ##
* Created by Rick Staa on 10/07/2017 - Version 2.0
 
Since TODOIST its Windows 10 app doesn’t support global shortcuts at the moment. I made a 2 little workarounds for the "open TODOIST" global shortcut.
	1. AutoHotKey workaround (Easy to set up, fast and Relibably)
	2. Vbs Workaround (Hard to setup, can be slow)

These workarounds add the following global TODOIST shortcuts to WIN 10:
    - alt+ctrl+a (Add new task)
    - alt+ctrl+s (open todoist)

## Installation Instructions ##
    1. [Download AutoHotKey.](https://autohotkey.com/)
    2. Install AutoHotKey.
    3. [Download the Workaround.](https://github.com/rickstaa/Todoist_Global_Shortcuts_WIN10/archive/master.zip)
    4. Unzip the Workaround file.
    5. Go to the "Todoist_Global_Shortcuts_WIN10\TODOIST_AHK" folder.
    6. Click on the "installer.vbs" file to install the workaround.

## The workaround is not working what now? ##
- Make sure AutoHotkey is running on startup.
- Ensure that you have the right user privileges to add files to your user startup folder.
