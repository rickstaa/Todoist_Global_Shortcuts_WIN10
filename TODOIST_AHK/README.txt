# This is a workaround to use global shortcuts for TODOIST on WINDOWS 10
*Created on 05/07/2017 - Version 1.0*

Since TODOIST its Windows 10 app doesn’t support global shortcuts at the moment. I made a 2 little workarounds for the "open TODOIST" global shortcut. 
    1. AutoHotkey workaround (Easy to set up, fast and Reliable)
    2. VBS Workaround (Hard to setup, can be slow)

These workarounds add the following global TODOIST shortcuts to WIN 10:
    - alt+ctrl+a (Add new task)
    - alt+ctrl+s (open todoist)
